---
Shop K-Beauty is deployed on Heroku.

## **Deployment Steps**
1. **Install the project requirements by creating a Pipfile** <br/>
In the terminal, enter the command ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt ``` and a file with all the requirements will be created.

2. **Create an external database on ElephantSQL.com** <br/>
The sqlite3 database that came with Django and which we have been using is only available for use in development. We need to create a new database that is suitable for production.
* Go to [ElephantSQL.com](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and click *Get a managed database today* button.
* Select Tiny Turtle by pressing the *Try now for FREE* button
* Select *Log in with GitHub* and authorize ElephantSQL with your selected GitHub account
* In the create new team form:
    * Add a *team name* (your own name is fine)
    * Read and agree to the Terms of Service
    * Select *Yes* for GDPR
    * Provide your email address
    * Click *Create Team*
* Click *Create New Instance*

If you already have an account, after logging in to ElephantSQL:
* Set up your plan
    * Give your plan a **Name** (This is commonly the name of the project)
    * Select *Select Region*
    * Select a region and data center (Choose the one closest to you)
    * Click *Review*
    * Check that your details are correct and then click *Create New Instance*
    * Return to the dashboard and click on the *database instance name*
    * Copy the database url

3. **Set up Heroku**
* Go to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) and log in
* Choose the New button and from the dropdown, select *Create new app*
* Add your preferred app name and select your location and click the create app button
* Add the **DATABASE_URL** Config Var by going to the settings tab
* Click *Reveal Config Vars*
* Add a Config Var **DATABASE_URL** and paste your ElephantSQL database URL in as the value

4. **Connect the external database to GitPod**
* In your **env.py** file add a new key, **DATABASE_URL** and give it the value of the copied database URL <br/>
```bash
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "the_copied_database_url")
```
* Install the **dj-database-url** package version 0.5.0 and **psycopg2** in the terminal with **pip3** to allow us to parse the URL we have copied above to a format that Django can work with: <br/>
```bash
pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
```
* and remember to add both to your **requirements.txt** file with: <br/>
```bash
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
* At the top of the **settings.py** file, import **dj_database_url** underneath the import for os <br/>
```python
import os
import dj_database_url
```
* In the **settings.py** file, comment out the default database setting and replace it to use the **DATABASE_URL** environment variable <br/>
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
* Run the showmigrations command in the terminal to confirm you are connected to the external database
```bash
python3 manage.py showmigrations
```
**Note:** this does not transfer the data, only the database structure
* If you are connected to the external database, you should see a list of migrations, but none of them are checked off
* Run the migrate command in the terminal
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```
5. **Fixtures**<br/>
**If you did not use fixtures to populate your database**, but instead manually added all your data via the Django admin, we now need to *transfer* the data from GitPod to your new database and we are going to do this using the **dumpdata** command. This will *dump* the data from SQLite into a JSON file (and later on the **loaddata** command to upload the JSON *dump* into the external database), both from the GitPod terminal.<br/>

**Dumpdata**
* First, we need to *dump* the data from SQLite into a JSON file. To do that we need to **make sure that GitPod is connected to SQLite.** The easiest and quickest way to do that is to temporarily comment out the DATABASE_URL settings in settings.py, and ﬁx the indentation:
```python
# if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
#    DATABASES = {"default: dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))"}
# else:
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "db.sqlite3"),
    }
}
```
* Save the **settings.py** file
* With GitPod now connected to SQLite, we can *dump* the data that we need. The command syntax is:
```bash
python3 manage.py dumpdata app_name > filename.json
```
This will automatically create the JSON file and will dump all the model instances of the app into the file. Shop K-Beauty's **products app** has a MainCategory, Category, Subcategory, Brand and Product models.
```bash
python3 manage.py dumpdata products > products.json
```
will dump all 5 models instances in the SQLite DB from the **products app** into a file called products.json.

You can run the same command again for the other apps. But bear in mind that the model/app that refers to another model in another app as Foreign Key needs to be uploaded after the one it refers to. For instance, the **reviews app** refers to the *user* model then you must load the **profiles** first, otherwise, you'll get a fixture error.

In order to avoid risking these errors, I personally just did the dumping and loading of data for the products app first and after getting to the stage where I was able to create a superuser for the new database, only then did I add the rest of the app's model instances.

**If you used fixtures for your project,** you can start to load in the fixtures here by **making sure that GitPod gets connected to our external Postgres database**
* In **settings.py**, uncomment the DATABASE_URL settings and fix the indentation:
```python
if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {"default: dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))"}
else:
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "db.sqlite3"),
        }
    }
```
* Save the **settings.py** file
 GitPod is now connected to the external database. Run **migrate** just to make sure that the latest migrations are applied to this external db:
 ```bash
 python3 manage.py migrate
 ```
**Loaddata**
* Use **loaddata** to upload the products JSON file by running:
```bash
python3 manage.py loaddata products.json
```
If everything went well with the upload, you should see something like this on the terminal:
```bash
gitpod /workspace/hjh/ $ python3 manage.py loaddata products.json
Installed 130 object(s) from 1 fixtures
```
* Create a superuser for your new database
```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the steps to create your superuser username and password.

6. **Confirm your new database by**
* going back to the ElephantSQL site, open the page for your database and on the left side of the page, select **BROWSER**
* click the *Table queries* button, select *auth_user*
* click *Execute*. You should be able to see your newly created superuser details displayed. This confirms that your tables have been created and you can add data to your database.

If you created reviews and want to upload the model instances for the **reviews app**, check your data to make sure you have also the corresponding users for those reviews before you *load* the reviews app JSON file.

7. **Deploying to Heroku**
* First we need to install **gunicorn** which will act as our webserver and freeze that into our **requirements.txt** file
```bash
pip3 install gunicoorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
* Create a **Procfile** in the root directory to tell Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn and serve our Django app.
```Procfile
web: gunicorn shop_kbeauty.wsgi:application
```
* Temporarily disable **collectstatic** by logging into the Heroku CLI in the terminal to tell Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:
```bash
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name
```
* We also need to add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in **settings.py** and also add the localhost so that GitPod will still work too:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['deployed-site-url', 'localhost']
```
* After saving the **settings.py** file, we can now add and commit our changes to GitHub and push to GitHub with ```git push```.
* Then using ```git push Heroku main``` to deploy to Heroku.

The app should be deployed, albeit without the static files as we are yet to set these up.

* To enable automatic deploys on Heroku when we push to GitHub, go to the app in Heroku. On the deploy tab, set it to connect to GitHub. Search for your repository and then click *connect*. Then click *Enable Automatic Deploys*.
