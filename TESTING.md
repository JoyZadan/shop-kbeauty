## Automated Testing and Validation
### HTML Validation
I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all the HTML files by direct input:
| Page | Result | Validation Details & Screenshots |
| ---- | :-: | -------------------------- |
| 'templates/home/index.html' | 0 error and 0 warning | [Homepage](./documentation/html_validation/homepage-html-validation.png) |

### Python Validation
At the project inception, I installed [PyCodeStyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#configuration) in my IDE and throughout the development, I was using it to test and fix the errors as they appear. I also used [Code Institute's Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to lint my Python code.

### Lighthouse Report
[Chrome DevTools' Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) was used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the site
#### Desktop
| Page | Performance (%) | Accessibility (%) | Best Practices (%) | SEO (%) | If score is below 90% |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| ['index.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-index-page-after-image-aspect-ratio-refactor.png) | 98 | 97 | 100 | 100 | Scores are above 90% on average |
| ['products.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-products-templates-products-page.png) - *Before multiple testing for possible solutions* | 57 | 97 | 100 | 100 | Extensive efforts were done to improve the Performance score for desktop by converting all images from png to next-gen webp and moving the Google font link from base.html to base.css. Shop K-Beauty currently has 100 products being rendered on this page. The [opportunities](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-products-templates-products-page-opportunities.png) suggested by Lighthouse to potentially improve the score point to **reduce initial server response time** and **serve static assets with an efficient cache policy** all point to third-party libraries and services. <br/>As a student project, I am only using Heroku's free dynos with ElephantSQL's free Postgres database and Amazon's free tier S3 to host the media and static files. Reading up on [how to improve the performance of the application](https://help.heroku.com/VKCGHPPB/how-do-i-improve-the-performance-of-my-app), Heroku suggests using production-suitable Dynos and Postgres DB, but these are not free. Meanwhile, Amazon S3's cache control is not working, despite using the same source code from the Boutique Ado walkthrough. Further development time is required to investigate Amazon's [File Cache and/or Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/aws-caching/). Meanwhile, when I validated the [same product page but filtered to show only all specials]((./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-products-templates-products-page-all-special-offers.png)), the results improved from Performance: 57% to **Performance: 80%**!. |
| ['products.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-products-page-new.png) - **After aspect ratio corrections and reducing DOM size testings** | 56 | 97 | 100 | 100 | In an effort to improve the Performance score, I cut in half the image width and size, ie, from original 250px by 300px (aspect ratio of 5:6), I reduced both width and height to 125px by 150px. This did not help increase the score. I also attempted to fix the excessive DOM size by minimizing child elements from: <br/>```<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 row-cols-md-3 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-5 mx-3 mb-5"> ``` <br/> to: <br/> ```div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3 my-3">``` .<br/> This effort did not make a dent in achieving the objective of improving the Performance score for desktop version of the products page. I since reverted these changes to the styling, as a personal preference to show more columns of products in a row for larger screens. The [opportunities and diagnostics](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-products-page-new-opportunities-diagnostics.png) again referred to third-party libraries as potential source for improvement. |
| ['product_detail.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-product-detail-page.png) | 95 | 98 | 100 | 100 | Scores are above 90% on average |
| ['bag.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-bag-page.png) | 95 | 98 | 100 | 100 | Scores are above 90% on average |
| ['checkout.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-checkout-page.png) | 88 | 94 | 100 | 100 | Aside from the [opportunities identified by Lighthouse to optimise the checkout page performance](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-checkout-page-opportunities-diagnostics.png), the desktop score may be futher improved by adding an explicit width and height for the image elements. After numerous testing on how best to achieve this, I deemed it best left for now as numerous attempts to fix this resulted in distorted display of an image as it seems to conflict with Bootstrap4's ```w-100``` attribute, unless I add width and height sizing for every single possible media query. This should be looked into though in the next sprint. |
| ['checkout_success.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-checkout-success-page.png) | 94 | 97 | 100 | 100 | Scores are above 90% on average |
| ['brands.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-brands-page.png) | 92 | 98 | 100 | 100 | Scores are above 90% on average |
| ['brand_detail.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/desktop-brand-detail-page.png) | 94 | 97 | 100 | 100 | Scores are above 90% on average |

#### Mobile
| Page | Performance (%) | Accessibility (%) | Best Practices (%) | SEO (%) | If score is below 90% |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| ['index.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-home-templates-home-index-page.png) | 79  | 93 | 92 | 98 | Extensive efforts were done to improve the Performance score for mobile by converting all images that appear on the index page (incl the largest contentful paint - hero image) from png to webp and setting explicit height and width to them. The opportunities to increase the score suggested by Lighthouse such as [eliminating render-blocking resources](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-home-eliminate-render-blocking-resources.png) and [reduce unused JS](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-home-reduce-unused-js.png) point to third-party libraries: Bootstrap, JQuery and Stripe. |
| ['products.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-products-page.png) | 49 | 97 | 100 | 99 | Unfortunately, the the image resize and the multiple testing to reduce excessive DIM size (see desktop for products page) did not improve performance on mobile version. The [opportunities suggested by Lighthouse](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-products-page-opportunities.png) include **reduce initial server response time**, **use HTTP/2**, **eliminate render blocking resources (stripe (biggest render blocking resource), bootstrap, base.css-amazonaws, fontawesome, jquery and popper**. These are third-party libraries and resources and are needed to make the site work. The diagnostics suggested to **serve static assets with an efficient cache policy** and to **avoid an excessive DOM size**. As mentioned earlier, Amazon S3's cache control is not working, despite using the same source code from the Boutique Ado walkthrough. Further development time is required to investigate Amazon's [File Cache and/or Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/aws-caching/). Meanwhile, for the next sprint, reducing the excessive DOM size should be a priority. |
| ['product_detail.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-product-detail-page.png) | 76 | 98 | 100 | 97 | Per the [Opportunities and Diagnostics from Lighthouse](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-product-detail-page-opportunities-diagnostics.png), the main cause of the low Performance score are again like the ones discussed above. |
| ['bag.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-bag-page.png) | 80 | 97 | 100 | 94 | Same as above, the Performance score is affected by third-party libraries and resources, as evidenced by [this screenshot](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-bag-page-opportunities-diagnostics.png). |
| ['checkout.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-checkout-page.png) | 75 | 94 | 100 | 97 | Aside from the [opportunities identified by Lighthouse to optimise the checkout page performance](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-checkout-page-opportunities-diagnostics.png), the mobile score may be futher improved by adding an explicit width and height for the image elements. After numerous testing on how best to achieve this, I deemed it best left for now as numerous attempts to fix this resulted in distorted display of an image as it seems to conflict with Bootstrap4's w-100 attribute, unless I add width and height sizing for every single possible media query. This should be looked into though in the next sprint. |
| ['checkout_success.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-checkout-success-page.png) | 73 | 97 | 100 | 93 | This is a page with no image being rendered, that had plagued me previously in other pages and that had been fixed, as much as possible. But again, the mobile Performance score – as evidenced by the [opportunities and diagnostics](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-checkout-success-page-opportunities-diagnostics.png) –  is affected by third-party libraries and resources, which are required for the site's applications to work. |
| ['brands.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-brands-page.png) | 82 | 97 | 83 | 98 | Opportunity to fix two brand logo images with incorrect aspect ratios |
| ['brand_detail.html'](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-brand-detail-page.png) | 75 | 97 | 92 | 98 | Similar to other pages, the site suffers in Performance score due to issues with [third-party resources and libraries](./documentation/lighthouse_report/mobile-brand-detail-page-opportunities-diagnostics.png). |

### WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to ensure that Shop K-Beauty's content is also accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, which are then corrected following the results of the initial evaluation.

In order to fully validate the page, I used the WAVE Chrome extension. This enabled me to test the pages that require user authentication.

| Page | WAVE This Page Result | Reasons for not fixing the contrast errors, if any |
| :-- | --- | --- |
| Bag Page | no errors |  |
| Checkout Page | no errors, 2 contrast errors | Both of the contrast errors point to the placeholder text for country but as it is a default Stripe styling, I decided to leave it alone as the placeholder text for other fields in the form uses the same font color from this class: <br/> ```.stripe-style-input::placeholder { color: #aab7c4 } ``` <br/> and they all passed the contrast validation. |
| Checkout Success Page | no errors |  |
| Products Page  | no errors |  |
| Product Detail Page  | no errors |  |
| Add a Product Page | no errors |  |
| Edit a Product Page | no errors |  |
| Brands Page | no errors |  |
| Brand Detail Page | no errors |  |
| Add a Brand Page | no errors |  |
| Edit a Brand Page | no errors |  |
| Profiles Page | no errors, 1 contrast error | This is the same contrast error as in the Checkout Page. |
| Reviews Page | no errors |  |
| Add a Review Page | no errors |  |
| Edit a Review Page | no errors |  |
| Review Detail Page | no errors |  |
| Wishlist Page | no errors |  |
| K-Beauty Tips Page | no errors |  |

| Terms &amp; Conditions Page | no errors |  |
| Return &amp; Refund Policy Page | no errors |  |
| Shipping Policy Page | no errors |  |
| 404 Error Page | no errors |  |

### Django Automated Testing
For the automated testing, the writing and running of these tests used [Django's built in test module](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/overview/). For each installed application, I created a folder called tests, added the ```__init__.py``` file and the separate files for testing the views, models and forms.

I also used coverage to generate the report and find out the percentage of statements that I was able to cover and those that I missed for every installed application. I tried to achieve as close to the 100% mark as I possibly can, but I am still fairly new to using Automated Testing and am looking forward to learning more to reach this goal.

#### Coverage
| Installed App Coverage Report | Cover in Percentage | Screenshot of Coverage Report |
| -- | :-: | :-: |
| bag app | 77% | [bag app cover](./documentation/coverage_report/coverage-report-bag-app.png) |

### Solved Bugs
| # | Bugs, Errors and Issues | Solutions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Error: You are trying to add a non-nullable field to without a default  | **Solution:** <br/>Choose option 1 from two options provided by Django when making migrations, add timezone.now, then migrate. <br/>A new error appeared: <br/>```TypeError: Field 'id' expected a number but got datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 20, 13, 54, 36, 590663, tzinfo=<UTC>)```. <br/>I then looked for the latest _auto_ file from migrations folder, then changed: <br/>```default=got datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 20, 13, 54, 36, 590663, tzinfo=<UTC>)``` <br/>to <br/>```default=1```. <br/>I was then able to migrate successfully. |
| 2 | Stripe Webhook errors, ```401 ERR```, x 23 times and 100% failure rate  |  After numerous attempts to solve this by going over and over the source code for webhook handlers, searching the Stripe docs and, Stack Overflow and Code Institute's Slack channels, the solution was to share my GitPod workspace |
| 3 | Static and media files not uploading on AmazonS3 bucket | Attempts at fixing this issue remained unsuccessful despite checking multiple times that the steps were followed correctly, that the new CORS configuration was correct and that the steps to creating the AWS Groups, Policies and Users for Shop K-Beauty were also followed and implemented. In the end, I was able to fix the issue by creating a new bucket with new policies. |
| 4 | Reviews were not deleting after an associated product is deleted  | Fortunately, this was a simple bug. I just had to edit the product (fk) in my review model. <br/>``` on_delete=models.SET_NULL``` was changed to ``` on_delete=models.CASCADE ```, then migrate. |
| 5 | **DoesNotExist at /accounts/login/** [error](./documentation/solved_bugs/does-not-exist.png) | In attempting to use [Django-flatpages](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/flatpages/) for the static pages such as terms and conditions, policies, etc., I encountered an issue of not being able to login to the deployed site or to site admin. As it was taking too long to get this flatpages to work, I decided to remove all the changes I have just made. But I made the mistake of tinkering with the [sites content in Django Admin](./documentation/solved_bugs/sites-in-django-admin.png) that caused the error or it could have been caused by allauth views throwing the error as some of the changes I made implementing flatpages included changes to the Middleware in project-level settings.py. <br/> **Steps Taken Towards a Solution:** <br/>1. Check the logs by logging in to the heroku cli <br/> ```heroku login -i ```<br/> ``` heroku apps ``` - this lists all the apps in Heroku <br/> ```heroku logs --tail -a <the app name> ``` - use the correct app name to run the logs command <br/> The logs came back with these: <br/> [heroku-logs-tail-part1](./documentation/solved_bugs/heroku-logs-tail-part1.png)<br/>[heroku-logs-tail-part2](./documentation/solved_bugs/heroku-logs-tail-part2.png)<br/>[heroku-logs-tail-part3](./documentation/solved_bugs/heroku-logs-tail-part3.png)<br/>[heroku-logs-tail-part4](./documentation/solved_bugs/heroku-logs-tail-part4.png)<br/>2. Looking at these errors, the simplest solution was to reset the database by running <br/>```python3 manage.py migrate```<br/> but it didn't work per the terminal:<br/> [No migrations to apply](./documentation/solved_bugs/migrate.png) <br/>3. As it didn't work, the next step was to reset the [ElephantSQL](./documentation/solved_bugs/elephantsql-reset-btn.png) site database and run ```python3 manage.py migrate``` again which came back with these: <br/> [running-migrations-after-resetting-elephantsql-part1](./documentation/solved_bugs/running-migrations-after-resetting-elephantsqldb-part1.png)<br/> [running-migrations-after-resetting-elephantsql-part1](./documentation/solved_bugs/running-migrations-after-resetting-elephantsqldb-part2.png)<br/>4. The migration worked, so the next step was to run the server ```python3 manage.py runserver ```<br/>5. Whoops! The products data were all gone (since the ElephantSQL was reset). But the login functionality now works! The great news was that I had fixtures so I can easily run dumpdata to load the data back. But since I had reviews, I first had to create a few users, starting with creating a superadmin. Next I uploaded the fixtures in specific order (this is important as the products data need access to required three foreign keys (the first three json files below), otherwise I would have gotten another error) by running: <br/>``` python3 manage.py loaddata <json filename> ``` <br/>a) maincategory.json <br/>b) category.json <br/>c) subcategory.json <br/>d) product.json <br/> After uploading the rest of the json files, the checkout and reviews fixtures, the site was back with all the data rendering and the functionalities working as expected. <br/> **Additional note:** I could have also run ``` python3 manage.py loaddata ``` to avoid uploading the files one by one, but I wanted to avoid any potential issues with some data requiring data from other files first. I never created a profiles fixtures, for security purposes.
| 6 | HTML Validation errors on add a product and edit a product pages in products app : **Error: Duplicate attribute id. At line 1351 column 69 id="id_image"** | This is a very interesting error, caused by conflicts between multiple languages. First, the JQuery script to change the image file uses an id of ```#new-image```. This caused a conflict with Django's forms widget clearable_file_input, <br/>````{% include "django/forms/widgets/attrs.html" %}````, which comes with a function <br/>```def clear_checkbox_id(self, name):``` <br/>```"""Given the name of the clear checkbox input, return the HTML id for it."""``` <br/>```return name + "_id"``` <br/>(see from line 438: [Github:Django/Django](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/widgets.py)). Because the script already uses ```#id-image```, when the file input is selected, it returns the HTML id, which resulted in HTML validation error of duplicate atttribute id. <br/><br/>**The solutions came in several steps:** <br/>1. Change the JQuery script from ``` #new-image``` to ```.new-image``` <br/>2. Change the custom_clearble_file_input.html (line 19): from ```<input id="new-image">``` to ```.new-image ``` <br/>3. We cannot leave it here because the forms.py file in the products app has a forloop that adds class attributes: ```for field_name, field in self.fields.items(): field.widget.attrs['class'] = 'border-black rounded-0'```. Left unsolved, we would just be exchanging a duplicate id error with a duplicate class error. So I deleted this forloop. <br/>4. To still have the ```border-black rounded-0``` attributes added to the add/edit a product forms, I then added these to new attributes to base.css ``` select, .form-control {border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-radius: 0 !important;}``` |
| 7 | HTML Validation errors on bag page: **Error: Duplicate ID** and a warning of The ``` type ``` attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources. | This is an error that seems to be fairly left unsolved in other ecommerce projects I've seen on GitHub. The fix seems fairly daunting at first, as it points to ``` item_id ```,  which when searching for this line of code across the project can be found on contexts.py, urls.py, views.py, on webhook_handler.py, on quantity_form.html and on quantity_input_script.html. <br/><br/>After initially feeling intimidated about the potential enormity of debugging this error, solving this is actually fairly simple. <br/><br/>**Solution**: <br/>1. On quantity_form.html, from the remove link (below the form), delete ``` id ``` and move ``` remove_{{ item.item_id }} ``` inside the attribute ``` class ```, thus <br/>``` class="remove_{{ item.item_id }}" ```. <br/>2. On script below the bag.html, replace ``` var itemId ``` with ``` var itemClass ```, then replace the ``` .attr('id') ``` with ``` .attr('class') ```. <br/>3. Replace ``` var url = `/bag/remove/${itemId}/`; ``` with ``` var url = `/bag/remove/${itemClass}/`; ```. <br/>To remove the warnings, I just delete the ``` type="text/javascript" ```. |
| 8 | HTML Validation errors on checkout page: **Error: The value of the ```for``` tag attribute of the ```label``` element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control** | **To fix this error, I took the following steps:** <br/>1. Deleted the label tag wrapping the two links to (create an account) and (login). <br/>2. I wrapped said links in a ```<p></p>``` to fix alignments for smaller device. <br/>3. I wrapped the non-link text in ```<span></span>``` to be able to add space between the texts. <br/>4. I tested that by deleting the ``` <label></label> ``` tag and the ```for="id-save-info"``` that was in the label, it will not cause stripe webhooks to stop working, that the links will still work and that a newly created account will still be saved and that there was no adverse effect to the functionalities on the checkout page. I also checked that when I tested the orders, the new orders were indeed saved in the database. <br/><br/>Additionally, when searching for a potential fix to this error, I came across an article from [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/html-inputs-and-labels-a-love-story/), which says, we should not put interactive elements inside labels such as links. I left the warning of empty heading caused by the loading-spinner.|
| 9 | **Product name field error on Django admin** when re-adding a just deleted product and **lack of defensive programming** | After I accidentally deleted a product (COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA+++ (50ml)), I realised there are two bugs I needed to fix. <br/><br/>1. The **first bug**: there was a problem with the name field on my Product model being set to ```unique=True``` since when I tried to add the same product I just deleted, the Django admin showed an error that the name already exists (even though the product was no longer in the db) and the product I was trying to add did indeed get added. Thus, even though adding again the same product was successful, I thought it best to amend the Product model because in a real life situation, products may need to be deleted and should the same products need to be added in the store again, store owners should not have to worry about a Django admin error. <br/>2. The **second bug**: the lack of defensive programming in the project, specifically on the button that allows a superadmin to delete a product. <br/><br/>**To fix these two bugs, I took the following steps**: <br/>1. I changed the name field on the product model to ```unique=False```, and ```migrate```.  <br/>2. Using a modal, I targeted the delete product buttons on the products page and on the product_detail page so that the superadmin will receive a warning prior to confirming the deletion of a product. |
| 10 | **ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2.5'** | I came across this bug accidentally when trying to find solutions to the JSHint validation warnings for Quantity Input Script **(products/templates/products/includes/quantity_input_script.html)**. The quantity form in product_detail.html doesn't allow the input of floats (as is expected). But in bag.html it does, so when a user tries to update a product quantity using floats, it triggers this Django error. <br/><br/>**The solution**: <br/>On bag.html, the script to update a product quantity on click ```form.submit()``` needs to be updated to ```form[0].requestSubmit()```. <br/><br/>Credit to [Igor Basuga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-basuga-b2a123111/), currently a Junior Developer and a former Full Stack Software Development Tutor at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for the well documented solution [Debugging - a Detective Story and a Learning Experience](./documentation/solved_bugs/debugging-a-detective-story-igor-ci.pdf) to this bug. |
| 11 | Modal in products.html works in development but not in production | After again accidentally deleting a product, this time in production, I realised that the defensive programming to prevent just this situation by using a modal works in development but not in production. <br/><br/>Since the same defensive programming is functioning successfully in product detail page, I used [Computed Diff](https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/) to check for any difference in the code and noticed that on products.html page, the delete a product button is [split into several lines](./documentation/solved_bugs/delete-product-button-modal-bug.png), compared to the same code and the same button on product_detail.html which is [all in one line](documentation/solved_bugs/delete-product-button-modal-bug-solved.png). Putting all the code for the delete a product button in one line solved the modal bug not working on products page in production. |
| 12 | Heroku Build failure | Testing ... as failure traceback says **Launching...Push failed due to an unrecognized error, and we've been notified.! Please try pushing again.! If the problem persists, see https://help.heroku.com/ and provide Request ID <>. Meanwhile, there's no error showing on the terminal. Pushing again solved the bug. |
| 13 | Unable to add new product if the product brand is not in the store yet | Shop K-Beauty is a multi-brand ecommerce store and a brand is required when adding a new product via the product management functionality.  When I tested adding a new product, I realised that a store owner can only add a product if said product's brand is already in the store. A store owner would have to add a brand via the Django admin, which is not ideal in a real life situation. To fix this, and since the code to add a brand is pretty much similar to adding a product and the custom clearable file input can also be reused, it makes sense to add the brand management functionality, starting with adding a brand. |
| 14 | A logged in user is able to add a product to their own wishlist even if the product is already in the wishlist | To Fix this, I first passed both the product and the user_product to the query for an existing duplicate wishlist by using <br/>```Wishlist.objects.get ``` <br/> This didn't work as the GET function will raise an error if a product does not exist in the wishlist. <br/> The next solution is to use a combination of filter/exists, which solved the bug: <br/> ```existing = Wishlist.objects.filter(product=product, user_profile=user).exists() ```.

| 15 |Discount (high to low) and Discount (low to high) sorting not working properly | First, there was a typo on the products template <br/> ```<option value="discount_asc" {% if current_sorting == 'discount_desc' %}selected{% endif %} ```. Whilst the value is "discount_asc", I made the mistake of having 'discount_desc' for the current sorting. This part was easily fixed. Second, although the sorting the products discounts started to work, there were still a few products that appeared before the discounts were sorted. I realised that there also some errors in the data for new arrivals were I added the discount as 0.00 but did not include the data for the original_price field. After adding the missing data, the sorting of discounts high to low and vice versa now both work as intended. |
| 16 | Whilst working on my unit tests, I got an operational error when I tried to log in to production site. The error says, ``` connection to server at rogue.db.elephantsql.com (35....), port 5432 failed: Connection refused ``` | As the unit tests were nowhere near production, this was a big puzzle. After checking that all as they should be on elephantsql (postgresdb), in the config vars in Heroku, and in the env.py file, the solution was to do a manual deploy from Heroku dashboard (deploy tab). |


### Known Bugs
| # | Known Bugs, Errors and Issues | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Browser: Chrome, Error: **Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received**. This error appears after about a minute or two of loading any page of the web application. | I have spent days looking for where this error was coming from, initially thinking it was caused by the show and hide button on the homepage to hide and show list of available brands. I switched off the event listener. The error still appeared. I tried to debug and refactor all the event listeners but found it impossible to do so without disabling the required JQuery functions for the application to run smoothly. Googling for possible causes and reasons, I have found references to the same error and they point to using incognito mode as a possible solution. The error did not appear when using incognito mode. Due to time constraints, the real solution for this error may be investigated further on the next sprint/ future development. |
| 2 | internal server error when registering a new account | This error came out of the blue since the account registration has been tested multiple times by friends and family and also by myself using temporary emails. After setting the project back and forth between DEBUG=True and DEBUG=False and even asking fellow students to test the account registration functionality, the server error did not appear again. Three other fellow students helped me try and uncover the source of this error by themselves registering a new account with Shop K-Beauty. None of them reported any error and the account registration worked as expected. I cannot recreate the error and neither does it appear again, but since I also did not knowingly solve this bug, I thought it best to list this as a known bug for now and one that I will try in the next sprint/ future development to investigate further. |
